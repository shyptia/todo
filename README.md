### Description

This is an application for managing your current tasks. The app features two tabs to track all todos and deleted todos. On the "All Todos" tab, you can add a new todo. Each todo allows you to change its status - completed or not completed, and you can also edit the todo's title by clicking on the pencil icon. Additionally, clicking on the delete icon removes the todo from the list of all todos and adds it to the list of deleted todos. On the "Deleted Todos" tab, you have the option to restore a todo.
